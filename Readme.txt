1. 'functions' folder includes all the functions you need for Fused/Grouped sPCA.
2. 'GBMD analysis' folder includes the dataset and master programs to conducting Glioblastoma data analysis, which results is demonstrated in our paper 'Incorporating Biological Information in Sparse Principal Component Analysis with Application to Genomic Data'.  This includes a good example to apply Fused/Grouped sPCA to real dataset.

3.  examplecode.m under main folder is the best way to get started with Fused/Grouped sPCA.
